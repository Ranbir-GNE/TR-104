Node.js: Understanding the Basics
1. What is Node.js?

    Definition:
    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside a browser.

    Key Features:
        Asynchronous and event-driven.
        Non-blocking I/O model for efficient handling of concurrent operations.
        Lightweight and scalable for building server-side and networking applications.

2. How Does Node.js Work?

    Runtime Environment:
    Node.js provides a runtime for executing JavaScript, powered by Chromeâ€™s V8 engine.
        The V8 engine, written in C++, compiles JavaScript into native machine code for faster execution.

    Single-Threaded Event Loop:
        Uses a single thread to handle requests and delegates heavy tasks (like file or database operations) to a thread pool.
        Employs an event-driven model to handle multiple requests efficiently.

3. Why Use Node.js?

    Advantages:
        Fast Execution: The V8 engine and non-blocking I/O make it ideal for building fast and responsive applications.
        Scalability: Its event loop and modular architecture allow for handling numerous concurrent connections.
        Unified Language: Use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, simplifying full-stack development.
        Rich Ecosystem: Thousands of packages available through npm (Node Package Manager).

    Common Use Cases:
        REST APIs and microservices.
        Real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, gaming servers).
        Streaming services.
        Command-line tools.

4. Node.js Internals

    Written in C++:
    Node.js combines JavaScript with C++ for performance-intensive tasks like networking and file operations.

    Powered by Chrome V8 Engine:
        V8 converts JavaScript code into machine code directly, enhancing speed and efficiency.
        Manages memory allocation and garbage collection.

Learning Outcomes
