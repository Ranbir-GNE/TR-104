Activities:
Today marked the beginning of my training, where I was introduced to the coursework and syllabus. The session provided a clear overview of the training objectives and the knowledge areas we will be covering. To kickstart the learning process, I spent some time revising my existing knowledge base to build a strong foundation for the upcoming tasks and projects. Additionally, I got acquainted with the web development framework and environment under which I will be working during the training.

Tasks Completed:

    HTML Smiley Project
        Drew a smiley face using HTML.
        Styled it with CSS to add colors and positioned it at the center of the page.
        This task reinforced basic HTML structuring and CSS styling concepts like positioning and alignment.

    JavaScript String Methods
        Explored built-in JavaScript functions such as toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), slice(), and splice().
        Learned about the basics of string manipulation and the practical applications of these functions.
        Practiced small exercises to solidify the understanding of string operations.

This introductory day helped me establish a baseline for the training and set a productive tone for the days ahead.
