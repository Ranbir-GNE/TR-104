Middleware in Node.js and Express
1. What is Middleware?

Middleware is a function in Node.js or Express that executes during the request-response cycle. It has access to:

    Request Object (req): The HTTP request data sent by the client.
    Response Object (res): The HTTP response data that the server sends back.
    Next Function (next): A function used to pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

Middleware can perform tasks such as:

    Executing any code (e.g., logging, authentication).
    Modifying the req and res objects.
    Ending the request-response cycle.
    Calling the next() function to pass control to the next middleware.

2. Why Use Middleware?

Middleware helps in:

    Modularity: Breaking the application into smaller, reusable pieces.
    Code Reusability: Centralized logic for logging, authentication, and error handling.
    Streamlined Workflow: Pre- or post-processing requests and responses.

3. How Middleware Works

Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined in the code.

    If next() is called, the next middleware in the chain is executed.
    If next() is not called, the request-response cycle ends.

4. Types of Middleware

    Application-Level Middleware
        Defined at the app level.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware executed');
  next(); // Passes control to the next middleware or route handler
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

Router-Level Middleware

    Applied to specific routes.

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Router middleware executed');
  next();
});

router.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About Page');
});

module.exports = router;

Built-In Middleware

    Provided by Express. Examples:
        express.json(): Parses incoming JSON requests.
        express.urlencoded(): Parses URL-encoded data.

Third-Party Middleware

    Installed via npm. Examples:
        cors: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
        morgan: HTTP request logger.

Error-Handling Middleware

    Handles errors in the application.

    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
      console.error(err.stack);
      res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
    });

5. Example: Custom Middleware

This middleware logs the method and URL of every incoming request.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const loggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Passes control to the next middleware or route handler
};

app.use(loggerMiddleware);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server is running on port 3000'));

6. Understanding next()

    The next() function is critical in middleware to avoid hanging requests.
    If next() is not called and no response is sent, the server will not respond, leading to a timeout.

Example:

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware 1 executed');
  next(); // Passes control to Middleware 2
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware 2 executed');
  res.send('Response sent from Middleware 2');
});
