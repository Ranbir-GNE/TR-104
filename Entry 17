Topic 1: Differentiating Among Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Frameworks
1. Definitions and Hierarchy

    Modules:
    A module is the smallest unit of reusable code in a project. It is a single JavaScript file or a collection of files that can be imported and used.
    Example:
        A file exporting a function in Node.js:

        module.exports = function greet() {
          console.log("Hello, World!");
        };

    Packages:
    A package is a collection of modules organized together with metadata (like a package.json file) that can be published and shared via package managers like npm.
    Example:
        Lodash is a package that contains multiple utility functions.

    Libraries:
    A library is a collection of pre-written code (packages/modules) that provides specific functionality or tools for a project. It offers flexibility in its usage.
    Example:
        React, Chart.js.

    Frameworks:
    A framework is a more comprehensive toolset than a library, offering a structured environment to build an application. Frameworks enforce conventions and provide a foundation for development.
    Example:
        Angular, Django.

2. Hierarchy

The relationship can be summarized as:
Modules < Packages < Libraries < Frameworks
Topic 2: package.json vs package-lock.json
1. package.json

    Definition:
    The package.json file is a manifest for a project that describes the metadata of the package (project).

    Contains:
        Project name, version, description, author, and license.
        Scripts for automation.
        Dependencies and devDependencies required for the project.

    Purpose:
        Defines the structure of the project.
        Specifies which packages are required.

    Example:

    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Example project",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node app.js"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.18.0"
      }
    }

2. package-lock.json

    Definition:
    The package-lock.json file is an auto-generated file that ensures the exact same dependency versions are installed across different environments.

    Contains:
        The complete dependency tree, including nested dependencies.
        Resolved versions of packages.

    Purpose:
        Locks down the specific versions of dependencies.
        Ensures consistency across installations (e.g., during npm install).

    Example:

    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "lockfileVersion": 2,
      "requires": true,
      "dependencies": {
        "express": {
          "version": "4.18.0",
          "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.0.tgz",
          "integrity": "sha512-..."
        }
      }
    }

Key Differences
Aspect	package.json	package-lock.json
Purpose	Defines project structure and dependencies.	Locks exact versions for reproducibility.
Creation	Created and maintained manually.	Auto-generated by npm.
Focus	High-level dependency overview.	Detailed dependency tree.
Modifiability	Manually editable by developers.	Should not be edited manually.
Learning Outcomes

    Differentiated between modules, packages, libraries, and frameworks, understanding their roles and relationships.
    Learned the significance of package.json and package-lock.json in managing dependencies in Node.js projects.
